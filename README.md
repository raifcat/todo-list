A simple todo list web application that uses:
1. Python FastAPI Framework
1. Jinja2 Templating engine
1. SQLite3 (Add a file called `database.db` in root)
1. ChatGPT (Add a file called `.env` file with the key `GPT_KEY` in root)

# How to use:
Put in the terminal: `python -m uvicorn main:app --reload` to launch the server.
